# Web APP

## System Requirements

Before starting please make sure that you have successfully installed the below dependencies on your development environment.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. We will use the latest LTS version.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - is the official Nodejs Package Manager (npm) which allows us to manage our dependencies and packages. It is automatically installed with nodejs, so you don't have to install it separately.

## Code Editor

Feel free to use any text editor / IDE you like. We personally recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## App details
The below 4 libraries were added:

- [Ant design](https://ant.design/) - for UI library/components

- [recharts](https://recharts.org/) - for building charts
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - for HTTP requests
